        <h1>Welcome to the number one staycation site out there!</h1>
        <p>With everything that is going on we aren't really allowed to travel right now so we decided to do the next
            best thing! Make a travel guide how to make the best stay at home vacation (staycation) that we can!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>History: we have been helping people have the best staycation they can since 2019. We are a
                        small
                        company but we have helped a lot of people have the best time they can at home.</li>
                    <li>Popular destations: Our favorite destation is the closest to you! Your home! </li>
                    <li>Target Clients: We are helping everyone who has to stay home with everything
                        going on. While some people can work from home there are a lot of people who are kind of
                        chilling at
                        home waiting for everything to blow over. Some of those mothers need the help that we can
                        provide
                        helping keep their children busy with school being online or out for the summer already. </li>
